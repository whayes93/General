# Linear-Algebra-
Tools for computerizing linear algebra, and later...multivariate statistics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a graduate student in psychology with hopes of going on to study quantitative methods in psychology, I have a huge interest in statistical computing. Many of the advanced statistical techniques I want to learn about (e.g., factor analysis, structural equation modeling, Bayesian inference, etc.) rely almost exclusively on computers. So I decided about a year ago to begin learning Python, which was a random selection, but I'm very glad I chose that language! 

I am currently teaching myself some of the foundations of higher-level stats (linear algebra, calculus, etc.), focusing on translating them into code. I have learned a lot from such books as Learning Python by Mark Lutz and Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications by Philip N. Klein. The latter resource gives great examples of Python code for creating mathematical objects like vectors, but I try to put my own spin on things.
